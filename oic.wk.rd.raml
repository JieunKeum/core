traits:
- rdgetinterface:
    queryParameters:
      if:
        description: |
          Interface is optional since there is only one interface supported for the Resource Type
          Both for RD selectin and for publish.
          Example:  GET /oic/rd?if=oic.if.baseline
        enum: [ "oic.if.baseline" ]

- rdpostinterface:
    queryParameters:
      rt:
        description: |
          Used in POST request to ask the RD to add the Links in payload to /oic/res.
          Example: POST /oic/rd?rt=oic.wk.rdpub
        enum: ["oic.wk.rdpub"]

      #"rt" query is used in POST request but such usage is unprecedented & out-of-sync with existing "rt" query practice,
      # so I recommend to remove this if IoTivity allows. Take notice here the absence of "rt" would produce the same result.

- rddelete-di:
    queryParameters:
      di:
        description: |
          This is used to determine which set of links to operata on. (Need authentication to ensure that there is no spoofing). If instance is ommitted then the entire set of links from this device ID is deleted
          Example: DELETE /oic/rd?di="0685B960-736F-46F7-BEC0-9E6CBD671ADC1"

- rddelete-ins:
    queryParameters:
      ins:
        description: |
          Instance of the link to delete
          Value of parameter is a string where instance to be deleted are comma separated
          Example: DELETE /oic/rd?di="0685B960-736F-46F7-BEC0-9E6CBD671ADC1";ins="20"

/oic/rd:
  displayName: Resource directory resource
  description: |
    Resource to be exposed by any Device that can act as a Resource Directory.
    1) Provides selector criteria (e.g., integer) with GET request
    2) Publish or Update a Link in /oic/res with POST request
    3) Delete a Link in /oic/res with DELETE request

  get:
    is: [ rdgetinterface ]
    description: |
      Get the attributes of the Resource Directory for selection purposes.

    responses:

          Respond with the selector criteria - either the set of attributes or the bias factor
        body:
          application/json:
            schema: rdSelection
            example: |
              {
                "rt": ["oic.wk.rd"],
                "if": ["oic.if.baseline"],
                "sel": 50
              }

  post:
    is: [ rdpostinterface ]
    description: |
      Publish the resource information for the first time or Update the existing one in /oic/res.
      Appropriates parts of the information, i.e., Links of the published Resources will be discovered through /oic/res.
      1) When a Device first publishes a Link, the request payload to RD may include the Links without "ins" Parameter.
      2) Upon granting the request, the RD assigns a unique instance value identifying the Link among all the Links it advertises
         and sends back the instance value in "ins" Parameter in the Link to the publishing Device.
      3) When later the publishing Device updates the existing Link, i.e., changing its Endpoint information,
         the request payload to RD needs to include the instance value in "ins" Parameter to identify the Link to update.
